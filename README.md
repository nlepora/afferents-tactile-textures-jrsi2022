# afferents-tactile-textures-jrsi2022

* Contains python code and jupyter notebooks for processing data, running analysis and generating figures for 'Artificial SA-I, RA-I and RA-II/Vibrational Afferents for Tactile Sensing of Texture' by Nicholas Pestell and Nathan Lepora
* Paper in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, January 2022.
* Data available from data.bris repository
* Begin with notebook preprocess/process, then in spatial/spatiotemporal/vibrotactile analyses run process_<analysis> first before training the models
* All testing is performed in the figures notebook
